## RSG: A Simple but Effective Module for Learning Imbalanced Datasets (CVPR 2021)

A Pytorch implementation of CVPR 2021 paper "RSG: A Simple but Effective Module for Learning Imbalanced Datasets". RSG (Rare-class Sample Generator) is a flexible module 
designed for learning from imbalanced datasets. It can generate rare-class samples during training and can be combined with any convolutional neural networks.
